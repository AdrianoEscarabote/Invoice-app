### The challenge

**My app allows users to:**

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Create, read, update, and delete invoices
- Receive form validations when trying to create/edit an invoice
- Save draft invoices, and mark pending invoices as paid
- Filter invoices by status (draft/pending/paid)
- Toggle light and dark mode
- Create a personalized account and log in
- Store their details securely in a database

### Continued development

This was my third full-stack project, and I felt an incredible ease in getting the backend and frontend to work together. I'm really happy about that. To challenge myself in this project, I decided to use Git Flow, a workflow widely used by software development teams.
